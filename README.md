### activeosd

activeosd, or ActiveFlashElement, is an abstraction of an active storage device
that can execute a code within the device itself. 
This implementation is based on [Linux TGT](http://stgt.sourceforge.net/)
and [OSD standard](https://mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/scsi/osd.txt).
activeosd is a building block of AnalyzeThis, a workflow-aware storage
appliance, which was presented in the following papers.
